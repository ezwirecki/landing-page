# landing-page
In thi project i needed to create entire webpage resist only on the picture of how the webpage looks like. It was test of using flexbox tool and flex properties but it wasn't to much complicated. Everything what i needed to use i've trained through the flex course in the odin project. Finally I needed to add some styling used css. I made this project straight the same like in the photo of example. 
Not to difficult but not to easy. I had a lot of fun with it!
